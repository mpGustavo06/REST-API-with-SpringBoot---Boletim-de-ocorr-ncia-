# REST API with SpringBoot - Boletim de ocorrÃªncia / Delegacia

* This repository contains two projects.

The first: An API that reads and persists records from a CSV file that contains theft crimes that occurred in Brazil and makes them available for consultation via HTTP methods. It is also possible to enrich the records through a new crime registry.

The second: It is a FrontEnd application to communicate with this API, where the records read in the CSV file are listed and new records are also registered.
